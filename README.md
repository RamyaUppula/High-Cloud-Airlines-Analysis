High Cloud Airlines – Operations & Delay Analysis

📌 Business Problem
Flight delays negatively impact customer satisfaction, operational costs, and airline reputation.  
This project analyzes airline operations data to identify major delay patterns and operational inefficiencies.

🎯 Objectives
- Identify airlines with highest and lowest delay rates  
- Analyze most delayed routes and airports  
- Study monthly and time-based delay trends  
- Provide recommendations to improve punctuality  

📂 Dataset
Source: Public airline performance dataset (Kaggle / DOT)  
Format: CSV  
Records Include:
- Flight number  
- Airline name  
- Origin & destination  
- Departure delay  
- Arrival delay  
- Cancellation status  

🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Excel  

🔍 Methodology (Step-by-Step Approach)

1. Imported raw dataset into Python  
2. Checked for missing values and duplicates  
3. Cleaned delay columns and formatted dates  
4. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
5. Created visualizations for trends  
6. Interpreted patterns and derived insights  

📊 Exploratory Analysis Performed

- Airline-wise average delay  
- Route-wise delay distribution  
- Monthly delay trend  
- Delay reasons (weather, carrier, air traffic)
